# payment-and-withdrawal-app-server

This is an Express Node.js application designed to act as the server-side backbone for the payment-and-withdrawal frontend. It provides endpoints for various payment operations and prioritizes strong Node security implementations, ensuring robustness and safety for all transactions.

## Features

- **Payment Operation Endpoints**: Well-structured routes and controllers to facilitate all payment-related operations from the frontend.
- **Strong Node Security**: Incorporation of industry-standard security practices for Node.js applications, ensuring data integrity and protection against potential vulnerabilities.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the server, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**:

bashCopy code

```
git clone https://github.com/kingsleykbc/payment-and-withdrawal-app-server.git
cd payment-and-withdrawal-app-server
```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:

bashCopy code

`npm install`

3.  **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory. Add your Paystack secret and public keys:

makefileCopy code

```
TEST_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
TEST_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here
```

4.  **Run the Server**: You can start the server using either `node` or `nodemon` (if you have nodemon installed globally or as a dev dependency for watching file changes).
    bashCopy code
    `node app`
    or
    `nodemon app`

Your server should now be running and ready to handle requests from the frontend.
